# Feature Specification: MediaForge — MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-mediaforge-create-mvp`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Ready  
**Input**: User description: "MediaForge: Create MVP feature spec including file conversion, background removal, color grading, and account/subscription requirements"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a creator or small business user, I can upload images and short videos, quickly convert formats, remove backgrounds, and apply color grading presets or manual adjustments so I can prepare media for publishing or ads without desktop software.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a supported image file (JPG/PNG/WEBP/HEIC/GIF), When the user selects Convert → format=JPG and Resize=1080x1080, Then the system returns a JPG at 1080x1080 and the user can download it.
2. Given an uploaded image with a distinct subject, When the user selects Remove Background → auto, Then the background is removed and the user can replace it with a solid color or uploaded background image.
3. Given an uploaded short video (<=30s and <=50MB), When the user selects Remove Background → Then the system performs frame-by-frame subject separation for short clips and provides a downloadable processed clip.
4. Given an uploaded image or video, When the user chooses a color grading preset (e.g., Cinematic), Then the preview updates and the user can export the graded asset in chosen format.
5. Given a free-tier user, When they export a processed file, Then the output is watermarked and subject to daily usage limits (3 jobs per day); Pro users get no watermark and priority processing (unlimited jobs).

### Edge Cases
- Unsupported file types: System must reject with clear message indicating supported formats.
- Very large files or long videos: System must provide a graceful failure or guidance (e.g., "file too large — try compressing"). Maximum upload sizes: 5MB for images; videos limited to 50MB or 30s duration (whichever is smaller).
- Background removal failure (complex edges/transparency): Provide fallback option for manual mask adjustment or recommend cropping/alternate image.
- Interrupted uploads or processing failures: Jobs should be retryable and return meaningful error codes/messages.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload image files in JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF, and HEIC formats via drag-and-drop or file picker.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to upload video files in MP4, MOV, and AVI formats via drag-and-drop or file picker.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide image conversion to target formats (including JPG and PNG) with options to resize and compress; conversions MUST be downloadable by the user.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide video conversion options including trim, change resolution, adjust frame rate, and merge clips; processed videos MUST be downloadable.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide algorithmic background removal for images with an option to replace the background with a solid color or custom uploaded background.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide basic video background removal for short clips (MVP: up to 30s and 50MB).
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide color grading presets (e.g., Vintage, Cinematic, Bright & Poppy) and manual sliders for hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast.
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to import LUT files for color grading (supported format: .cube; maximum size: 1MB).
- **FR-009**: System MUST support batch processing for image conversion (select multiple files and apply same operation).
- **FR-010**: System MUST expose job-based asynchronous processing for long-running tasks and return a jobId for status polling.
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide progress updates for processing jobs via polling or WebSocket.
- **FR-012**: System MUST offer account tiers: Free (limited daily use, watermark) and Pro (paid subscription, no watermark, priority processing).
- **FR-013**: System MUST enforce access rules based on subscription tier (e.g., daily quotas of 3 jobs for Free, unlimited for Pro; maximum 1 concurrent job for Free, 5 for Pro).
- **FR-014**: System MUST encrypt uploads in transit and at rest and automatically delete ephemeral files after 24 hours post-upload or job completion (auto-delete sooner on post-download/session end).
- **FR-015**: System MUST present clear UI controls: drag-and-drop upload, left-side tool navigation, real-time preview with side-by-side before/after, contextual tool controls, and export panel.

### Non-Functional Requirements (high level)
- **NFR-001**: Processing time: Short image tasks should complete in under 10 seconds for typical images (<5MB); video tasks under 60 seconds for clips <=30s (<=50MB).
- **NFR-002**: Availability: MVP services should target 99% uptime for core processing APIs.
- **NFR-003**: Security: System SHALL follow GDPR/CCPA-friendly practices; tokens, PII, and uploads MUST be handled per privacy policy.

### Key Entities
- **User**: represents an account with attributes: id, email, subscription_tier (Free, Pro), daily_quota (e.g., 3 for Free), account_created_at.
- **MediaAsset**: represents an uploaded file with attributes: id, user_id, original_filename, format, size_bytes, width, height, duration (for video), status (uploaded, processing, ready, failed), created_at, expires_at.
- **Job**: represents an asynchronous processing task with attributes: id, media_asset_id(s), job_type (convert, remove_bg, color_grade), parameters, status, progress, result_location, created_at, completed_at.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: Maximum video length for background removal in MVP → A: 30 seconds.
- Q: Exact Free/Pro quotas and differences → A: Free: 3 jobs/day, 1 concurrent job, watermarked outputs; Pro: unlimited jobs, up to 5 concurrent jobs, no watermark, priority queueing (soft paywall on quota exceed).
- Q: Maximum upload file sizes for images and videos in MVP → A: Images: 5MB; Videos: 50MB or 30 seconds (whichever is smaller).
- Q: Supported LUT formats and size limits → A: .cube only; maximum 1MB.
- Q: Exact retention timeframe for ephemeral files → A: 24 hours after upload or job completion (auto-delete after that or post-download/session end).
- Q: Performance targets and SLA → A: Image tasks <10s for <5MB; Video tasks <60s for ≤30s clips; Availability SLA: 99% uptime (monthly, excluding scheduled maintenance).


## Open Questions & Assumptions
- Assumption: Core UX layout and controls follow the provided UX Design Document; where specifics are missing, standard, minimal interactions are assumed.
- Assumption: Subscription pricing and billing integration (e.g., $9.99/month for Pro) are handled outside MVP scope but enforced via tiers.
- Dependencies: Relies on secure file upload mechanisms and basic user authentication for tier enforcement.
